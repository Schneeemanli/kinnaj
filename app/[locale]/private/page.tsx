        <strong>General / Introduction</strong>
        <br />
        Based on Article 13 of the Swiss Federal Constitution and the data
        protection provisions of the Swiss Confederation (Data Protection Act,
        DSG), every person has the right to protection of their privacy as well
        as protection against misuse of their personal data. The operators of
        these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We
        treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the legal
        data protection regulations as well as this privacy policy.
        <br />
        <br />
        In cooperation with our hosting providers, we make every effort to
        protect the databases as well as possible against unauthorized access,
        loss, misuse or falsification.
        <br />
        <br />
        We would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g.
        communication by e-mail) can have security gaps. A complete protection
        of data against access by third parties is not possible.
        <br />
        <br />
        By using this website, you consent to the collection, processing and use
        of data in accordance with the following description. This website can
        generally be visited without registration. Data such as pages accessed
        or names of files accessed, date and time are stored on the server for
        statistical purposes without this data being directly related to your
        person. Personal data, in particular name, address or e-mail address are
        collected as far as possible on a voluntary basis. Without your consent,
        the data will not be passed on to third parties.
        <br />

        <strong>Cookies</strong>
        <br />
        This website uses cookies. These are small text files that make it
        possible to store specific information related to the user on the user's
        terminal device while the user is using the website. Cookies make it
        possible, in particular, to determine the frequency of use and number of
        users of the pages, to analyze behavior patterns of page use, but also
        to make our offer more customer-friendly. Cookies remain stored beyond
        the end of a browser session and can be retrieved when you visit the
        site again. If you do not wish this to happen, you should set your
        Internet browser so that it refuses to accept cookies.
        <br />
        <br />A general objection to the use of cookies used for online
        marketing purposes can be declared for a large number of the services,
        especially in the case of tracking, via the U.S. site
        http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or the EU site
        http://www.youronlinechoices.com/. Furthermore, the storage of cookies
        can be achieved by disabling them in the browser settings. Please note
        that in this case not all functions of this online offer can be used.

        <strong>With SSL/TLS encryption</strong>
        <br />
        This website uses SSL/TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect
        the transmission of confidential content, such as requests that you send
        to us as the site operator. You can recognize an encrypted connection by
        the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to
        "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line.
        <br />
        <br />
        If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us
        cannot be read by third parties.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Contact form</strong>
        <br />
        If you send us inquiries via the contact form, your data from the
        inquiry form including the contact data you provided there will be
        stored by us for the purpose of processing the inquiry and in case of
        follow-up questions. We do not pass on this data without your consent.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Data Subject Rights</strong>
        <br />
        Right to confirmation
        <br />
        Every data subject has the right to request confirmation from the
        website operator as to whether personal data concerning him or her are
        being processed. If you wish to exercise this right of confirmation, you
        may, at any time, contact the Data Protection Officer.
        <br />
        <br />
        Right of access
        <br />
        Every person affected by the processing of personal data has the right
        to receive information free of charge from the operator of this website
        at any time about the personal data stored about him or her and a copy
        of this information. Furthermore, information may be provided about the
        following, if applicable:
        <br />
        the purposes of processing
        <br />
        the categories of personal data processed
        <br />
        the recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed
        <br />
        if possible, the planned duration for which the personal data will be
        stored or, if this is not possible, the criteria for determining this
        duration
        <br />
        the existence of a right to obtain the rectification or erasure of
        personal data concerning him or her, or the restriction of processing by
        the controller, or a right to object to such processing
        <br />
        the existence of a right of appeal to a supervisory authority
        <br />
        if the personal data are not collected from the data subject: Any
        available information about the origin of the data.
        <br />
        Furthermore, the data subject has the right to be informed whether
        personal data have been transferred to a third country or to an
        international organization. If this is the case, the data subject also
        has the right to obtain information about the appropriate safeguards in
        connection with the transfer.
        <br />
        If you would like to make use of this right to information, you can
        contact our data protection officer at any time.
        <br />
        <br />
        Right to rectification
        <br />
        Every person affected by the processing of personal data has the right
        to demand the immediate correction of incorrect personal data concerning
        him or her. Furthermore, the data subject has the right, taking into
        account the purposes of the processing, to request that incomplete
        personal data be completed, including by means of a supplementary
        declaration.
        <br />
        If you wish to exercise this right of rectification, you may contact our
        data protection officer at any time.
        <br />
        <br />
        Right to erasure (right to be forgotten)
        <br />
        Any person concerned by the processing of personal data has the right to
        obtain from the controller of this website the erasure without delay of
        personal data concerning him or her, where one of the following grounds
        applies and insofar as the processing is no longer necessary:
        <br />
        The personal data have been collected or otherwise processed for such
        purposes for which they are no longer necessary.
        <br />
        The data subject revokes the consent on which the processing was based
        and there is no other legal basis for the processing
        <br />
        The data subject objects to the processing on grounds relating to his or
        her particular situation and there are no overriding legitimate grounds
        for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing in the
        case of direct marketing and related profiling
        <br />
        The personal data have been processed unlawfully
        <br />
        The erasure of the personal data is necessary for compliance with a
        legal obligation under Union or Member State law to which the controller
        is subject
        <br />
        The personal data has been collected in relation to information society
        services provided directly to a child
        <br />
        If one of the above reasons applies and you wish to arrange for the
        deletion of personal data stored by theoperator of this website, you can
        contact our data protection officer at any time. The data protection
        officer of this website will arrange for the erasure request to be
        complied with immediately.
        <br />
        <br />
        Right to restriction of processing
        <br />
        Any person concerned by the processing of personal data has the right to
        obtain from the controller of this website the restriction of processing
        if one of the following conditions is met:
        <br />
        The accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for
        a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal
        data
        <br />
        The processing is unlawful, the data subject objects to the erasure of
        the personal data and requests instead the restriction of the use of the
        personal data
        <br />
        The controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the
        processing, but the data subject needs it for the assertion, exercise or
        defense of legal claims
        <br />
        The data subject has objected to the processing on grounds relating to
        his or her particular situation, and it is not yet clear whether the
        legitimate interests of the controller override those of the data
        subject
        <br />
        If one of the aforementioned conditions is met, you can request the
        restriction of personal data stored by the operator of this website at
        any time by contacting our data protection officer. The data protection
        officer of this website will arrange the restriction of the processing.
        <br />
        <br />
        Right to data portability
        <br />
        Every person affected by the processing of personal data has the right
        to receive the personal data concerning him or her in a structured,
        common and machine-readable format. He or she also has the right to have
        this data transferred to another controller if the legal requirements
        are met.
        <br />
        Furthermore, the data subject has the right to obtain that the personal
        data be transferred directly from one controller to another controller,
        insofar as this is technically feasible and insofar as this does not
        adversely affect the rights and freedoms of other persons.
        <br />
        To assert the right to data portability, you may at any time contact the
        data protection officer appointed by the operator of this website.
        <br />
        <br />
        Right of objection
        <br />
        Any person affected by the processing of personal data has the right to
        object at any time, on grounds relating to his or her particular
        situation, to the processing of personal data concerning him or her.
        <br />
        The operator of this website shall no longer process the personal data
        in the event of the objection, unless we can demonstrate compelling
        legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests,
        rights and freedoms of the data subject, or if the processing serves the
        purpose of asserting, exercising or defending legal claims.
        <br />
        To exercise the right to object, you may directly contact the Data
        Protection Officer of this website.
        <br />
        Right to revoke consent granted under data protection law
        <br />
        Every person affected by the processing of personal data has the right
        to revoke a given consent to the processing of personal data at any
        time.
        <br />
        If you wish to exercise your right to revoke consent, you may contact
        our data protection officer at any time.
        <br />
